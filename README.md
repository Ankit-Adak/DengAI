# DengAI
Abstract
The goal of our project is to create a Predictive Model that can use relevant
information about the factors that are responsible for vector-borne epidemics
such as Dengue and can predict the occurrence of the same in the nearby locality
so that the public medical staff can prepare for and manage the spread of
epidemic. This model will provide new insights into our understanding and
management of health, disease and healthcare system by developing a real-time
adaptive computation software that could predict the dengue incidences in
advance and that can also be applied for other similar vector-borne diseases.

Conclusion
From our earlier analysis, we can arrive at a general conclusion that when these
conditions are forecasted to occur, it is advisable for necessary precautions to be
taken especially in areas where prior cases of dengue have been found in large
numbers. Health officials should be made aware of the same in the such areas, so
that they may be better prepared.
On comparison of various models that were used to draw conclusion, it is found
that for this given data, Random Forest Regressor was quite accurately able to
predict future cases. The following table shows the models with the least MAE.
